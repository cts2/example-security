example-security - An Example CTS2 Development Framework Security Plugin
======================

example-security is a demonstration Security Plugin for the CTS2 Development Framework.
There is no source code other than Spring Configuration files. Implementors may use this
as a starting point for more robust security solutions, such as LDAP authorization.
Security Plugins must register a 'javax.servlet.Filter' Service.
